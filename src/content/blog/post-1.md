## Appearance

## Personality

Clumsy and introverted, Mirai often describes situations as *"How unpleasant!"* (不愉快です！). Despite her shy demeanor, she possesses a strong sense of duty and gradually opens up to those around her. Her love for bonsai trees and blogging adds depth to her character, showcasing her desire for normalcy amidst her supernatural responsibilities.

## Abilities

Mirai's unique ability, known as **hemokinesis**, allows her to manipulate her blood into weapons, primarily forming a sword. This power is considered heretical among Spirit World Warriors, leading to her ostracization. Overusing this ability can cause severe anemia, adding a layer of vulnerability to her character.

## Backstory

Born into a cursed bloodline, Mirai's early life was marked by tragedy. After the loss of her family, she was adopted by the Inami family, where she formed a close bond with Yui Inami. However, when Yui became possessed by a youmu, Mirai was forced to kill her, leading to deep-seated guilt and further isolation. This traumatic event set the stage for her initial encounter with Akihito Kanbara.

## Relationships

- **Akihito Kanbara:** Initially tasked with killing Akihito, a half-youmu, Mirai's relationship with him evolves into a deep bond. Their interactions are central to the series, highlighting themes of acceptance and understanding.
- **Sakura Inami:** Yui's younger sister, who initially seeks revenge against Mirai but eventually becomes her ally.
- **Mitsuki Nase:** A fellow Spirit World Warrior who supports Mirai, helping her navigate the complexities of their world.

## Legacy

Mirai Kuriyama's character arc is a poignant exploration of self-worth, redemption, and the struggle to find one's place in the world. Her journey resonates with many, making her a memorable figure in anime storytelling.
